This program has been done many a time, but I had about an hour of time to kill so I decided I'd roll my own.

It's fairly short and I tried to comment things per line, rather than just expecting individuals to understand my train of thought, unlike other solutions I've seen.

I suggest running the script and piping it to another file, opening that file and copy+pasting instead of using the straight terminal.

e.g. ./perl HTS_Dictionary.pl > answer.txt
